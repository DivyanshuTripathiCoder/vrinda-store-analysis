->What I Analyzed: I created this dashboard to answer key business questions:
Which months had the best sales?
Do men or women buy more?
Which states bring in the most revenue?
What's the relationship between age and gender in purchasing?
Which sales channels (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.) perform best?
What are the order statuses (delivered, returned, cancelled)?

->Key Findings
Customer Behavior:
-Women make up 65% of customers (men are 36%)
-The 30-49 age group drives 50% of all sales
-92% of orders are successfully delivered
Top Performing States:
-Maharashtra - ₹29.9 Lakhs
-Karnataka - ₹26.5 Lakhs
-Uttar Pradesh - ₹21.0 Lakhs
Best Sales Channels:
-Amazon: 35.5%
-Myntra: 23.4%
-Flipkart: 21.6%

->My Recommendation: Focus marketing on women aged 30-49 in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Run targeted campaigns on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra since these platforms drive 80% of orders.
